# Shellcase

Shellcase is a command-line interface for performing tasks on Debian-based desktops.

It is a metascript, containing multiple simple bash scripts that can be quickly started through a simple menu. These are scripts that I need in the moment. If you want to test this script, I recommend using a virtual machine.

This script is meant to be used as a template for your own scripts/often used commands. Please read the script before executing!

## Warning

Please do not use this script on a productive system without understanding first what it does! It is capable of making permanent deep changes that you may not want!

## Run without installation

You can run the current stable version without installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/burij/shellcase
cd shellcase
chmod +x shellcase
./shellcase
```


## Installation

To install the current development version on the system, use the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/burij/shellcase
cd shellcase
chmod +x install-shellcase.sh
./install-shellcase.sh
```
